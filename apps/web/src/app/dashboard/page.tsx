// That schedule will remain the schedule for each data fetch, meaning we donâ€™t planning on adding monthly or yearly schedule, so the user can update it when the weekly changed
// The data should be change to this json
// Also, the user can set whether is time schedule is public or not, that part is done by calling to a function as the user is not permit to remove the any permission.
