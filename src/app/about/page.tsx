          Challenges: How to increase global connectivity{' '}
        </h2>

        <p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
          Working in a remote company across different time zones presents a
          unique set of challenges. Coordinating meetings and ensuring real-time
          collaboration can be particularly difficult, communication delays can
          slow project progress, asynchronous communication becomes the norm,
          and urgent issues may not be addressed promptly. Building a cohesive
          team culture is more challenging when spontaneous interactions and
          face-to-face meetings are rare, balancing these challenges requires
          strategic planning, flexible work schedules, and robust communication
          tools to bridge the gaps caused by geographical time differences.
          Especially when timezones change, and colleagues change location,
          currently available tools use features which focus on scheduling,
          without focusing enough on the single biggest blocker to cohesive
          working, visibility.
