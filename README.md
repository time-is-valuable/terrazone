### Footnote
Terrazone heavily relies on the Appwrite permission system.
Appwrite permission system gives the ability to use the API in a seeming way. The documents being returned from the API request going through the permission system and any document that won't match the current user (whether it's a guest or logged-in user) won't be fetched.

Doing so helps to short the amount of time requires for development.
